# iCOPeDApp

iCOPeD is a self-management mobile application for respiratory diseases. 
It consists of lifestyle, educational, management, and risk features. It 
is applicable to a range of respiratory diseases, beyond COPD including asthma. 
It utilizes new and state-of-the-art machine learning models to allow users to engage 
in the most recent technology. 

# Goals

The ultimate goal of the project is to provide users a holistic self-management app for 
respiratory patients. Currently, respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of death 
worldwide and one of the hardest to manage. Chronic respiratory diseases are the leading cause 
of unnecessary hospitalizations. In the age of telemedicine, it is essential to improve self-management 
buy providing users with easy-to-access features to maintain and forecast their condition.

# Software

There were many tools we utilized to make iCOPeD possible. The two main languages we used for this code were 
CSS and JS. The following frameworks we used were React Native and Bootstrap.

<ul>Bootstrap</ul> 
Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography. We used bootstrap for enhanced design of operators and functional tools, such as forms, buttons, and other interface components. 

<ul>React Native</ul> 

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React's framework along with native platform capabilities. We used React Native to set up functional navigation and rendering of third-party apps.
